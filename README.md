# INF552 Final project: A visual history of the news from 2003 to 2020

## Introduction

This project visualizes the occurrence of words in the news headlines of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in the past two decades. It is based on the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines, which contains over a million news headlines spanning every day from February 19th, 2003 to December 30th, 2020. Every major global news event is captured in this dataset, with a stronger presence of australia-related topics.

I attempted to show the history of usage of specific words in the news, similarly to google's n-gram function. To use the tool, simply enter a word into the query box. The number of times it appears in the news each week is plotted.
